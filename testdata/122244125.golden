== Backstory ==
In the rugged hills of the dwarven lands, Calder Ironarm was born into a clan renowned for their prowess in battle. From a young age, he showed an unparalleled ferocity and strength, earning him the respect of his kin. As he grew, so did his reputation as a formidable soldier, his name whispered with both fear and admiration among his people. Calder's loyalty to his clan was unwavering, but his methods were often deemed too brutal even by their standards. He had a tendency to disobey orders if he deemed them too cautious, always preferring to charge headlong into battle, his mighty warhammer in hand. While his actions brought victories, they also left a trail of destruction in their wake, earning him the ire of his superiors.

Eventually, Calder's insubordination reached a breaking point, leading to his banishment from the clan. Cast out and adrift, he wandered the lands in search of purpose, his heart heavy with the weight of his exile. It was during this time of soul-searching that fate led him to a desolate temple hidden among the crags and valleys. The temple, dedicated to Talona, the goddess of death and disease, called out to Calder with an eerie allure. Within its shadowed halls, he found solace amidst the whispers of the forgotten gods. In Talona's teachings, he discovered a new path, one that embraced the inevitability of death and the power it held over mortals.

Vowing his life to the goddess of decay, Calder embraced his newfound calling with zeal. He became a devout follower, offering his strength and skills in service to Talona's dark designs. With each passing day, his connection to death grew stronger, his once mighty warhammer now a grim instrument of the goddess's will. Now, as a servant of Talona, Calder roams the lands, a harbinger of death and decay. His path is shrouded in shadow, his actions guided by the will of his dark mistress. And though he walks alone, he knows that he is never truly without purpose, for in death, he finds his greatest strength.

Despite his dedication to Talona, Calder's longing for his old clan never truly fades. Deep within his heart, there remains a flicker of hope that one day he may earn their forgiveness and be welcomed back into the fold. He knows that his path diverges sharply from the traditions of his people, but the bond of kinship is a bond not easily broken. In his quieter moments, amidst the whispers of the temple and the echoes of his past, Calder dreams of a reconciliation. He imagines proving himself anew, demonstrating his worth not only as a warrior but as a changed dwarf, tempered by the teachings of Talona.

Yet, he also knows that such a journey will not be easy. The wounds of his banishment run deep, and the scars of his past actions are not easily forgotten. Still, Calder remains determined, his resolve unshaken as he walks the precarious line between his old life and the dark path he now treads. In his quest for redemption, Calder finds himself torn between two worlds, his loyalty to his clan conflicting with his newfound allegiance to Talona. But in the end, he knows that only through acceptance and forgiveness can he truly find the peace he seeks, whether it be within the embrace of his old kin or the shadowy embrace of the goddess of death.

== Other ==
Calder stands at a sturdy 4 feet tall, his muscular frame weathered by years of battle and devotion. His skin is bronzed from exposure to the elements, bearing the scars of countless conflicts. Despite his advanced age, there is a vitality in his gaze that speaks of his indomitable spirit.

However, what truly captures attention are Calder's eyes—piercing orbs of intense blue that seem to gleam with a maniacal fervor. Behind their fiery depths lies a fierce determination and a hint of something darker, hinting at the depths of his unwavering devotion to his cause.

A fiery red mohawk adorns Calder's head, a symbol of his fierce determination and defiance. The hair, kept meticulously groomed, serves as a striking contrast to the gray strands that pepper his beard and temples. His beard, braided with intricate runes and charms, speaks of his deep connection to dwarven tradition and faith.

Draped across his broad shoulders is a suit of sturdy chainmail, polished to a gleaming sheen. Over it, he wears a weather-beaten cloak emblazoned with the symbols of both his clan and his deity, Talona. At his side hangs a heavy warhammer, its haft carved with intricate dwarven runes and symbols of war and death. Despite its size, Calder wields it with ease, the weapon an extension of his own formidable strength.

In battle, Calder's presence is commanding, his voice booming with the authority of both warrior and cleric. He moves with a fluidity born of years of training, his strikes precise and devastating. Yet, behind his ferocious exterior lies a heart devoted to his comrades and his faith, willing to lay down his life in service to both.
